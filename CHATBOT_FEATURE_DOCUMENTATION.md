## File Structure

```
client/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ChatBot.jsx           # Main chatbot component
â”œâ”€â”€ layout/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RootLayout.jsx        # Public pages layout (includes chatbot)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DashboardLayout.jsx   # Student dashboard layout (includes chatbot)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AdminLayout.jsx       # Admin panel layout (includes chatbot)
```

## How It Works

### 1. Component Structure
The `ChatBot.jsx` component is a self-contained React component that includes:
- Floating chat button
- Chat window with header
- Messages area with scrolling
- Input area with send button
- Quick action buttons

### 2. Integration
The chatbot is integrated into three main layouts:
- **RootLayout**: Available on all public pages (Home, Courses, About, etc.)
- **DashboardLayout**: Available in the student dashboard
- **AdminLayout**: Available in the admin panel

### 3. State Management
The chatbot uses React hooks for state management:
- `isOpen`: Controls chat window visibility
- `messages`: Stores conversation history
- `inputValue`: Tracks current input
- `isTyping`: Shows typing indicator

### 4. Response System
The bot uses a simple pattern-matching system to provide responses:
```javascript
const getBotResponse = (userMessage) => {
  const message = userMessage.toLowerCase();
  
  if (message.includes('course')) {
    return "Course-related response...";
  }
  // ... more patterns
}
```

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Response Patterns
To add new response patterns, edit the `getBotResponse` function in `ChatBot.jsx`:

```javascript
// Add this in the getBotResponse function
if (message.includes('your_keyword')) {
  return "Your custom response here...";
}
```

### Modifying Quick Actions
Edit the `quickActions` array in `ChatBot.jsx`:

```javascript
const quickActions = [
  { label: 'ðŸ“š Your Label', message: 'Message to send' },
  // Add more quick actions
];
```

### Styling Customization
The chatbot uses your app's CSS custom properties. You can customize:

1. **Colors**: Modify in `client/src/index.css`
```css
:root {
  --brand: #5b9cff;           /* Primary brand color */
  --brand-strong: #3b82f6;    /* Stronger brand color */
  --bg-primary: #0a0e1a;      /* Background color */
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

2. **Dimensions**: Adjust chat window size in `ChatBot.jsx`
```javascript
// Current dimensions
className="w-[380px] h-[600px]"

// Modify as needed
className="w-[400px] h-[650px]"
```

3. **Animations**: Modify animation classes in the component

### Mobile Responsiveness
The chatbot is fully responsive with:
- Adaptive width on mobile: `calc(100vw - 2rem)`
- Adaptive height on mobile: `calc(100vh - 2rem)`
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Optimized text sizes for small screens

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **AI Integration**: Connect to OpenAI or other AI services for more intelligent responses
2. **Backend Integration**: Store conversation history in database
3. **Rich Media**: Support for images, links, and formatted text
4. **Voice Input**: Add speech-to-text capability
5. **Multi-language**: Support multiple languages
6. **File Uploads**: Allow users to share files
7. **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor chat analytics
8. **Notifications**: Push notifications for new messages

### AI Integration Example
To integrate with OpenAI API:

```javascript
const getBotResponse = async (userMessage) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are Litera's helpful assistant..." },
          { role: "user", content: userMessage }
        ]
      })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.choices[0].message.content;
  } catch (error) {
    return "I apologize, I'm having trouble connecting...";
  }
};
```

- **Screen Reader Friendly**: Proper semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Auto-focus on input when opened

## Performance

### Optimization Tips

2. **Message Virtualization**: For long conversations, implement virtual scrolling
3. **State Persistence**: Consider using localStorage for message history
4. **Debouncing**: Implement input debouncing for better performance
